        classic, with its whimsical yet eerie sound and visuals. melanie's music
        explores themes of childhood trauma, mental illness, and societal
        pressures, often using characters like Cry Baby to convey her messages.

      <h1>CryBaby: the character</h1>
      <p>
        "Cry Baby" is a recurring character in Melanie Martinez's music and
        visual art, who serves as a representation of vulnerability, innocence,
        and emotional honesty. Cry Baby is depicted as a child-like figure with
        a distinctive style that includes oversized bows, colorful outfits, and
        curly pigtails. However, underneath her cute appearance, Cry Baby is
        often portrayed as being troubled and misunderstood, grappling with
        issues such as heartbreak, abuse, and societal pressures.

      <p>
        Portals shows her perspective through rebirth. as seen throughout the
        music videos and song names. we see Cryababy in a new, Pink-skinned,
        4-eyed form (as seen on the album cover) and how shes breaking free from
        her past self. the album is still commonly refered to as mm3 (Melanie
        Martinez 3) during the time fans leaked some of her upcoming songs.
        almost half of the mm3 leaks were on the album

      <h3>scandals & leaks</h3>
      <h1>the accusations</h1>
      <p>
        melanies biggest contrevery was when she was accused of Sexual Assault
        on december 4,2017. a woman named timothy heller, one of her close
        friends, accused her of assulting her. melanie shortly disspelled the
        rumors on twitter.
      </p>

      <h1>Countless Leaks</h1>
      <p>
        One of the biggest problems melanie has faced in regards to her carrer
        is the countless leaks. though the leakers are annonymus its known that
        at least a few tracks came directly from her producers selling these
        tracks. as stated previously, mm3 or portals had most of its songs
        leaked. though the offical releases were different from the leaks the
        simmalarities were obvious and made the album underwhelming for some
        fans. melanie contradicts herself when talking about leaks because at
        times she says that
